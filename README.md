# The nooSFere site

The URL to access nooSFere is <https://https://www.noosfere.org/>.

Here is a site really rich that covers French publications about what they call "publications de l’imaginaire".

Anybody is able to find reference to books, note about the authors, copy of the last cover page... to name a few. This site just looks to me like an encyclopedia. : [What noosfere claims as content (sure, in French...)](https://www.noosfere.org/noosfere/pro/stats_bases.asp))..

nooSFere gives home to non professional sites: [nooSFere - Sites
d'adherents](https://www.noosfere.org/noosfere/heberges.asp)

nooSFere gives home to authors  and illustrators sites : [nooSFere -
Sites d'auteurs](https://www.noosfere.org/noosfere/sites_auteurs.asp)

I will not reproduce here what the site best describe...

nooSFere does NOT sell nor edit any books. The association do propose to their members some very nice services for readers (cost about 30€ a year down to 10€ under some conditions.) 
See [Why sould I become adherent?](https://www.noosfere.org/noosfere/assoc/pourquoi.asp).

I do NOT make any pub, but I do appreciate this site a lot...
Carefull noosfere has anounced some changes in the future:

## cal-noosfere

My idea about this development is to be able to download the information about a volume into Calibre.

# cal-noosfere-util

cal-noosfere-util is an optional utility to support cal-noosfere. It present a customised internet browser from where to chose the volume from noosfere.

It will record the nsfr_id, it wipes out some metadata fields that calibre will not touch if nothing replaces it.

Once all that is set, the metadata source plugging may be invoked and because the nsfr_id is the prime hint, all the downloaded
metadata will be accurate. (well, I hope so :) )
