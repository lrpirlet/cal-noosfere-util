This plugin should complement cal-noosfere.
Issues: 
1 Cal-noosfere CANNOT wipe out a new metadata empty field
  example: if a previous metadata source download, from anywhere, did set the series
  to "something", and noosfere metadata source finds NO series,
  then calibre will NOT wipe out the series field.
2 A book may exist under several volumes... Each may differ because of a re-edition
  by the same or by a different editor... it may even be part of one or several anthology
  with possibly a different author and/or title and/or ISBN. I made some choice but this
  may NOT be the best fit. Solution is to manually go to the book page and chose the best
  volume by setting the nsfr_id, and restarting cal-noosfere metadata source plugin.
3 Cal-noosfere does allow for overloading the publisher field with the collection and
  the index of the collection. It, then,  becomes necessary to split this info in custom
  columns.
  
Intentions:
1 Provide some pre-processing by wiping out some fields, set nsfr_id to the new desired volume.
2 Provide some post-processing by splitting and setting the information where it needs to go.

Remark: I just NOT a professional developer... This is more like a hobby to learn about python...
If I succeed, fine... read: no commitment. :-)

Used as a base for this the experience gathered during a failing attempt to go interactive
from within cal-noosfere metadata source plugin.

Worked on a spawned WebEngineView and added some unique toolbar... (great PyQt5 experience,
A little bit like fighting mud... you see nothing clearly, find lots of examples, find many docs 
that looks contradictory till you grasp something that invalidate what you though you 
understood... anyway, it is still fun for a hobby :-)... I do think sometimes that Mickey mouse 
programming or assembler is easier... )

Spawned process seems to work fine for both data in and data out...
