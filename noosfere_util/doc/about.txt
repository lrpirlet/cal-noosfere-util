The noosfere utilité plugin
===========================

Created just to learn Python... I have fun :-). Please
consider that I have no problem with, and reserve the 
right to ignore any error, choice and poor optimization.
I use it, it is MY problem... You use it, it is YOUR problem.

Many thanks to all those people copyrighting their work
to GPL. In particular thanks to Kovid Goyal who started
calibre under GPL, and all the contributors...

I used " Apprendre à programmer avec Python 3" from
Gérard Swinnen. I got the copy from 
https://python.developpez.com/cours/apprendre-python3/ 
I was helped a lot by the publications in stackoverflow,
in particular the class explanation:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28684053/python-turn-giant-function-into-class

I got my icons from https://icons8.com/, I do like the 
https://icons8.com/icons/ultraviolet theme...

I used https://www.deepl.com/translator to verify my
translations (well, I do not feel too concerned with that
as I do think both in French and English... I tend to
forget what is the current language I use...)

I do NOT write software for a living. Others do, don't
forget it if you use it. If my code does merit some, think of 
starving people, deeply burned children, cancer research
or... You name it.
