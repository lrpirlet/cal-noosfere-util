The noosfere utilité plugin
===========================

This plugin should complement noosfere DB, a metadata download plugin.

Issues in cal-noosfere:
1 noosfere DB CANNOT wipe out a new metadata empty field
 example: if any previous metadata download plugin did set the series
 to "something", when noosfere metadata source finds  NO series, then
 calibre will NOT wipe out the series field. (expected behaviour!)

2 A book may exist under several volumes... Each may differ because
 of a re-edition by the same or by a different editor... It may even
 be part of one or several anthology with possibly a different author'
 name and/or title and/or ISBN. 
 I made some choice but that may NOT be the best fit. Solution is to
 manually go to the book page, choose the best volume by setting
 the nsfr_id and restart the noosfere DB metadata source plugin.

3 noosfere DB does not allow modifying customized column, but allows
 overloading the publisher field with the collection and the index of
 the collection.
 It, then, becomes necessary to split this info in custom columns.

So, select some relevant books in calibre that have the wrong volume
 (edition) displayed.
Use calibre-utilité to wipe out their metadata, except title, authors
 and id such as ISBN and to add the nsfr_id of the volume of your choice.
Execute a metadata update to populate calibre with the information
 associated with your choice.

So, select some relevant books that have the publisher field overloaded.
 Use calibre-utilité to setup the publisher and the custom publisher
 collection and the custom collection serial.
