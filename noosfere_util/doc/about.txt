The noosfere utilité plugin
===========================

This plugin should complement cal-noosfere.

Issues in cal-noosfere:
1 Cal-noosfere CANNOT wipe out a new metadata empty field
 example: if a previous metadata source download, from anywhere,
 did set the series to "something", and noosfere metadata source finds
 NO series, then calibre will NOT wipe out the series field.

2 A book may exist under several volumes... Each may differ because
 of a re-edition by the same or by a different editor... it may even
 be part of one or several anthology with possibly a different author
 and/or title and/or ISBN. I made some choice but this  may NOT be
 the best fit. Solution is to manually go to the book page and choose
 the best volume by setting the nsfr_id, and restarting cal-noosfere
 metadata source plugin.

3 Cal-noosfere does not allow modifying customized column, but allows
 overloading the publisher field with the collection and the index of
 the collection.
 It, then, becomes necessary to split this info in custom columns.

So, select some relevant books in calibre that have the wrong volume
 (edition) displayed.
Use calibre-utilité to wipe out their metadata, except title, authors
 and id such as ISBN and to add the nsfr_id of the volume of your choice.
Execute a metadata update to populate calibre with the information
 associated with your choice.

So, select some relevant books that have the publisher field overloaded.
 Use calibre-utilité to setup the publisher and the custom publisher
 collection and the custom collection serial.
